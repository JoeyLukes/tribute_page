        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p>Now that you know the basics about PC Setups, read the specifcs of each component from their own repective pages.
        Keep in mind that each component of your setup builds upon the other. For example, your choice of monitor affects
        your choice of graphics card, or vice versa. Are you going for a budget build? Are you going to pick parts based
        on a certain color scheme? These are all questions that you should find the answers to as you look to put together
        your own setup.</p>

        <h2> PC Specs </h2>
        <p>The Specifications of your PC are very important for the technical side of your setup.
          Will you be gaming competitvely or casually? Will you just be using it for work?
          All of these things must be taken into account when selecting your parts. The main PC
          parts include but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Processor (CPU)</li>
            <li>MotherBoard</li>
            <li>Graphics Card</li>
            <li>Storage (Hardrive or SSD)</li>
            <li>RAM</li>
            <li>Cooling System</li>
            <li>Power Supply</li>
            <li>Case</li>
          </ul>
          <p> How powerful your parts will affect the capabilites of your PC, so it is important to keep a price to value ratio in mind.</p>

        <h2> Peripherals </h2>
        <p>A common misconception is that the keyboard, mouse, headset, and monitor are are separate from your computer.
        In reality, they are accessories separate from your computer that allow you to use it. The most common peripherals are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keybaord</li>
          <li>Mouse</li>
          <li>Monitor(s)</li>
          <li>Headset</li>
          <li>Microphone</li>
          <li>Speakers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The type of peripheral works in tandem with your PC parts to produce the experience you desire. In order to type
        and use the computer interface you must have a keyboard and mouse. If you want to listen to audio out loud, invest in
        some speakers. If you want to listen to audio privately, get a headset.</p>

        <h2> The Setup </h2>
        <p>The Setup is what is going to make your room pop. This is where your actual PC, your Peripherals, and the
        rest of the room tie together. Many times, a color scheme is chosen and LED lights are put behind the monitors and
        desk to tie the color of the room together. If you want an all white theme, you might want to pick a white Case for
        your PC, as well as some white Peripherals like a white mouse or keyboard. Other ways you can tie your Setup together
        is buy buying RAM that has RGB lights, so that your PC lights up the desired color inside of the case. However,
        the setup should be whatever is most comfortable for the user, and you can make it look as colorful or dull as you'd like.
